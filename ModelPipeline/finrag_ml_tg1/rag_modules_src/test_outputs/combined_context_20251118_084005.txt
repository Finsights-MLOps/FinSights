Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses.

The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies throughout fiscal year 2015, and continuing into fiscal year 2016, negatively impacted reported revenue and reduced reported expenses from our international operations.

See a discussion of these factors and other risks under Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K).

Seasonality Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers.

Unearned Revenue Quarterly and annual revenue is impacted by the deferral of revenue, primarily including: • Revenue deferred on Windows 10 licenses to reflect ratable recognition over the life of the device.

• Revenue deferred on bundled products and services (“Bundled Offerings”).

We have recast certain previously reported amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor segment performance.

PART II Item 7 We expect to report the financial performance of LinkedIn as part of our Productivity and Business Processes segment.

Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 21 - Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).

SUMMARY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 Revenue decreased $8.3 billion or 9%, primarily due to the impact of the net revenue deferral from Windows 10 of $6.6 billion and an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately $3.8 billion or 4%.

Windows 10 revenue is primarily recognized at the time of billing in the More Personal Computing segment, and the deferral and subsequent recognition of revenue is reflected in Corporate and Other.

More Personal Computing revenue decreased, mainly due to lower revenue from Devices and Windows, offset in part by higher revenue from search advertising and Gaming.

Intelligent Cloud revenue increased, primarily due to higher revenue from server products and cloud services and Enterprise Services.

As we have diversity of target audiences and sales motions within the Windows business, we monitor metrics that are reflective of those varying motions.

Windows OEM Pro revenue growth Revenue from sales of Windows Pro licenses sold through the OEM channel, which primarily addresses demand in the commercial market Windows OEM non-Pro revenue growth Revenue from sales of Windows non-Pro licenses sold through the OEM channel, which primarily addresses demand in the consumer market Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue growth Revenue from Windows Commercial products and cloud services, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings Surface revenue Revenue from Surface devices and accessories Xbox content and services revenue growth Revenue from Xbox content and services, comprising Xbox Live (transactions, subscriptions, cloud services, and advertising), video games, and third-party video game royalties Search advertising revenue, excluding TAC, growth Revenue from search advertising excluding traffic acquisition costs (“TAC”) paid to Bing Ads network publishers PART II Item 7 SUMMARY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) exclude the net tax impact of transfer of intangible properties in fiscal year 2019 and the net tax impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) in fiscal years 2019 and 2018.

Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for a reconciliation of our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial results.

Fiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019 Revenue increased $17.2 billion or 14%, driven by growth across each of our segments.

Intelligent Cloud revenue increased, driven by server products and cloud services.

Productivity and Business Processes revenue increased, driven by Office Commercial and LinkedIn.

More Personal Computing revenue increased, driven by Windows and Surface.

PART II Item 7 Fiscal Year 2019 Compared with Fiscal Year 2018 Sales and marketing expenses increased $744 million or 4%, driven by investments in commercial sales capacity, LinkedIn, and GitHub, offset in part by a decrease in marketing.

Expenses included a favorable foreign currency impact of 2%.

General and Administrative General and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, severance expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources and other administrative personnel, certain taxes, and legal and other administrative fees.

Fiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019 General and administrative expenses increased $226 million or 5%, driven by charges associated with the closing of our Microsoft Store physical locations, offset in part by a reduction in business taxes and legal expenses.

Fiscal Year 2019 Compared with Fiscal Year 2018 General and administrative expenses increased $131 million or 3%.

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET The components of other income (expense), net were as follows: We use derivative instruments to: manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification.

Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.

To encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms utilizing our products and enterprise applications optimized for our GPUs, we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community.

Engineering and marketing personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss our products, as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical problems.

Our developer program makes certain that our products are available to developers prior to volume availability in order to encourage the development of software applications and game titles that are optimized for our products.

As NVIDIA’s business has evolved from gaming to broader areas and from chips to platforms, so, too, have our avenues to market.

SHIELD products, such as our gaming tablet and Android TV device, are sold through e-tail channels and through some of the world’s largest retailers.

Backlog Our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders.

The quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers' requirements and in manufacturing availability.

RISK FACTORS In evaluating NVIDIA and our business, the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below.

Any one of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, which could cause our stock price to decline.

Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business.

Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Partners If we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets, our revenue and financial results will be adversely impacted.

NVIDIA-branded products and services are visual computing platforms that address four large markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter, and Automotive.

Our products, services and technologies are designed to meet the evolving needs of these markets; however, these markets remain extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product and/or service offerings, industry standards continue to evolve and new competitors enter these markets.

Our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify and develop new products, services and technologies, and enhancements to our existing products, services and technologies, in a timely and cost-effective manner and to achieve consumer and market acceptance of them.

These provisions include the following: •the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval; •the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent; •advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; •the ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval; •a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws; •the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders; and •the ability of our Board of Directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws.

On March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox.

Under the agreement, if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock.

The Microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA.

These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.

Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.

Gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue.

Our overall gross margin was 56.1%, 55.5% and 54.9% for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

The increase over these fiscal years was driven primarily by a richer product mix in our GPU business, partially offset by lower Tegra business margins.

Charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions totaled $112 million, $59 million and $50 million for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, unfavorably impacting our gross margin by 2.2%, 1.3% and 1.2%, respectively.

Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $32 million for both fiscal year 2016 and 2015 and $43 million for fiscal year 2014, favorably impacting our gross margin by 0.6%, 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively.

As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 1.6%, 0.6% and 0.1% in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Revenue from our patent license agreement with Intel concluded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.

Gross margin for fiscal year 2018 was 59.9%, compared with 58.8% a year earlier, reflecting a favorable shift in mix, the growth of our GeForce gaming GPUs, and the growth of our GPU computing platform for cloud, deep learning, AI, and graphics virtualization, partially offset by the conclusion of our patent license agreement with Intel.

Operating expenses for fiscal year 2018 were $2.61 billion, up from $2.13 billion in the previous year.

This reflects growth in employees and related costs, as well as investments in growth initiatives, including gaming, AI, and autonomous driving.

We recorded a U.S. tax reform provisional net tax benefit of $133 million associated with the one-time transition tax on our historical foreign earnings and the adjustment of deferred tax balances to the lower corporate tax rate.

Net income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2018 were $3.05 billion and $4.82, respectively, up 83% and 88%, respectively, from a year earlier, fueled by strong revenue growth and improved gross and operating margins.

We returned $1.25 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2018 through a combination of $909 million in share repurchases and $341 million in quarterly cash dividends.

Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased by 12% due primarily to higher sales in both high end desktop and mobile workstation products.

Revenue from GeForce GPU products for mainstream PC OEMs increased by over 90% due primarily to strong demand for GPU products targeted for cryptocurrency mining.

GPU business revenue increased by 39% in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016.

This increase was primarily due to increased revenue from our GeForce GPU gaming and datacenter platforms.

We also believe that deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, particularly in China have impacted consumer demand for our GeForce gaming GPU products.

In addition, sales of certain high-end GeForce gaming GPUs using our new Turing architecture that we released during fiscal year 2019 were lower than we expected for the launch of a new architecture.

As a result, during a portion of fiscal year 2019, we shipped a higher amount of desktop gaming GPU products relative to where end user demand turned out to be and subsequently compensated by shipping a lower amount of desktop gaming GPU products relative to end user demand to allow the channel to work down that inventory.

For fiscal year 2020, we expect our Gaming revenue to be slightly down compared to fiscal year 2019, with expected growth from sales of Turing-based GPU products and notebook GPU products partially offsetting decreases that we believe were caused by the previously-noted factors.

Professional visualization revenue was $1.13 billion, up 21% from a year earlier driven by strength across both desktop and mobile workstation products.

Datacenter revenue was $2.93 billion, up 52% from a year ago, led by strong sales of our Volta architecture-based products, including NVIDIA Tesla V100 and DGX systems.

Toward the end of fiscal year 2019, we believe that customers across broad-based vertical markets and geographies became increasingly cautious due to economic uncertainty, and a number of Datacenter deals did not close.

Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.

Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors.

Therefore, investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance.

Factors, other than those described elsewhere in these risk factors, that could affect our results of operations in the future include, but are not limited to: • our ability to achieve volume production of our next-generation products; • our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services; • fluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies; • changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our partners’ products; • our ability to cover the manufacturing and design costs of our products through competitive pricing; • our ability to comply and continue to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations; • product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues; • our ability to secure appropriate safety certifications and meet industry safety standards; • supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our products • inventory write-downs; • our ability to continue generating revenue from our partner network, including by generating sales within our partner network and ensuring our products are incorporated into our partners product ecosystems, and our partner network’s ability to sell products that incorporate our GPUs and Tegra processors; • the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments to us, and our ability to obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers; • customer bad debt write-offs; • any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; • unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property; • changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards; and • general macroeconomic or industry events and factors affecting the overall market and our target markets.

Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results.

Any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility.

Privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential users from using our products and services, result in liability, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings.

These provisions include the following: • the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval; • the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent; • advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; • the ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval; • a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws; • the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders; and • the ability of our Board of Directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws.

On March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox.

Under the agreement, if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock.

The Microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA.

These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.

Operating expenses for fiscal year 2020 were $3.92 billion, up 16% from a year ago, reflecting primarily employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including stock-based compensation and infrastructure costs.

Income from operations for fiscal year 2020 was $2.85 billion, down 25% from a year earlier.

Net income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2020 were $2.80 billion and $4.52, respectively, both down 32% from a year earlier reflecting lower revenue and higher operating expenses.

The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants.

The consummation of the merger is conditioned on the receipt of the approval of Mellanox shareholders, as well as the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement.

A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 27, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2019, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com.

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of revenue.

Revenue Revenue by Reportable Segments GPU Business.

GPU business revenue decreased by 7% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, which reflects a decline in GPUs sold for gaming.

GeForce GPU product sales for gaming decreased by 10%, reflecting lower sales of GeForce desktop GPUs and SoCs for gaming platforms, partially offset by growth in GeForce notebook GPUs.

Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased by 7%, reflecting strength in desktop and notebook workstations.

Data Center revenue, which includes Tesla, GRID and DGX, increased by 2%, driven by vertical industry growth partially offset by lower hyperscale sales.

Tegra Processor Business.

Tegra Processor business revenue decreased by 6% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019.

This was driven by a decline in revenue from SoCs for gaming platforms, which was partially offset by an increase of 9% in Automotive revenue, reflecting growth in AI cockpit solutions and development services agreements.

Concentration of Revenue Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 92% and 87% of total revenue for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location.

Dell represented approximately 11% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020 and was attributable to the GPU business.

No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2019.

Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue.

Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, and shipping costs.

Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.

Our overall gross margin was 62.0% and 61.2% for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The increase in fiscal year 2020 was driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components.

Inventory provisions totaled $161 million and $270 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $145 million and $41 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.

As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was insignificant in fiscal year 2020 and an unfavorable impact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019.

A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows: GPU Business.

The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2020 when compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components.

Tegra Processor Business.

The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business was relatively flat during fiscal year 2020 when compared to fiscal year 2019.

Operating Expenses Research and Development Research and development expenses increased by 19% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs and stock-based compensation expense.

Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources As of January 26, 2020, we had $10.90 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $3.48 billion from the end of fiscal year 2019.

Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain limits on our portfolio duration.

Cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to changes in working capital driven by a reduction in inventory, partially offset by a decrease in operating income.

Cash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to lower purchases, higher sales, and lower maturities of marketable securities in preparation for the acquisition of Mellanox.

Cash used in financing activities decreased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to no share repurchases in fiscal year 2020 and lower tax payments related to employee stock plans.

Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations.
