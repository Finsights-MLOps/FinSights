FREQUENTLY USED TERMS Return on Average Capital Employed Return on average capital employed (ROCE) is a performance measure ratio.

From the perspective of the business segments, ROCE is annual business segment earnings divided by average business segment capital employed (average of beginning and end-of-year amounts).

These segment earnings include ExxonMobil’s share of segment earnings of equity companies, consistent with our capital employed definition, and exclude the cost of financing.

The Corporation’s total ROCE is net income attributable to ExxonMobil excluding the after-tax cost of financing, divided by total corporate average capital employed.

The Corporation has consistently applied its ROCE definition for many years and views it as the best measure of historical capital productivity in our capital-intensive, long-term industry, both to evaluate management’s performance and to demonstrate to shareholders that capital has been used wisely over the long term.

Additional measures, which are more cash flow based, are used to make investment decisions.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2.

Accounting Changes Effective December 31, 2017, the Corporation revised its accounting policy election related to the reporting of certain sales and value-added taxes imposed on and concurrent with revenue-producing transactions with customers and collected on behalf of governmental authorities (sales-based taxes).

This changes reporting of sales-based taxes from gross reporting (included in both “Sales and other operating revenue” and “Sales-based taxes”) to the preferable method of net reporting (excluded from both “Sales and other operating revenue” and “Sales-based taxes”) in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

The revised election makes reported revenue more consistent with ExxonMobil’s role as an agent for the government and is more consistent with the reporting practices of other international major oil and gas companies and the largest U.S. companies.

This change in accounting principle was applied retrospectively and does not affect net income attributable to ExxonMobil.

Also effective December 31, 2017, the Corporation reclassified U.S. Federal excise tax from “Sales-based taxes” to “Other taxes and duties”.

For these taxes ExxonMobil is not considered to be an agent for the government and these taxes will continue to be reported gross.

The amount reclassified was $3,110 million in 2016 and $3,044 million in 2015.

This change in classification was applied retrospectively and does not affect net income attributable to ExxonMobil.

Effective January 1, 2018, ExxonMobil adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s standard, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended.

The standard establishes a single revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry and transaction specific requirements, and expands disclosure requirements.

The standard was adopted using the Modified Retrospective method, under which prior year results are not restated, but supplemental information on the impact of the new standard must be provided for 2018 results, if material.
