Large scale consolidation within processors could result in these processors developing bilateral agreements or in some cases switching the entire transaction on their own network, thereby disintermediating us.

• Regulation in the EEA may disintermediate us by enabling third-party processors opportunities to route payment transactions away from our networks and towards other forms of payment.

• Although we partner with technology companies (such as digital players and mobile providers) that leverage our technology, platforms and networks to deliver their products, they could develop platforms or networks that disintermediate us from digital payments and impact our ability to compete in the digital economy.

This risk is heightened when we have relationships with these entities where we share Mastercard data.

While we share this data in a controlled manner subject to applicable anonymization and data privacy standards, without proper oversight we could inadvertently share too much data which could give the partner a competitive advantage.

• Competitors, customers, technology companies, governments and other industry participants may develop products that compete with or replace value-added products and services we currently provide to support our switched transaction and payment offerings.

These products could replace our own switching and payments offerings or could force us to change our pricing or practices for these offerings.

As a result, information security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us.

As cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.

Any of the risks described above could materially adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.

In addition to information security risks for our systems, we also routinely encounter account data compromise events involving merchants and third-party payment processors that process, store or transmit payment transaction data, which affect millions of Mastercard, Visa, Discover, American Express and other types of account holders.

These events, some of which have been high profile, typically involve external agents hacking the merchants’ or third-party processors’ systems and installing malware to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of those systems.

Further events of this type may subject us to reputational damage and/or lawsuits involving payment products carrying our brands.

Damage to our reputation or that of our brands resulting from an account data breach of either our systems or the systems of our customers, merchants and other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our integrated products and services.

Risk factors 18 MASTERCARD 2019 FORM 10-K PART I ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS Legal and Regulatory Payments Industry Regulation Global regulatory and legislative activity directly related to the payments industry may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.

Regulators increasingly seek to regulate certain aspects of payments systems such as ours, or establish or expand their authority to do so.

Many jurisdictions have enacted such regulations, establishing, and potentially further expanding, obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products and services that we may offer to financial institutions for consumers, the countries in which our integrated products and services may be used, the way we structure and operate our business and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products or services.

Large scale consolidation within processors could result in these processors developing bilateral agreements or in some cases switching the entire transaction on their own network, thereby disintermediating us.

• Regulation in the EEA may disintermediate us by enabling third-party providers opportunities to route payment transactions away from our networks and towards other forms of payment.

• Although we partner with technology companies (such as digital players and mobile providers) that leverage our technology, platforms and networks to deliver their products, they could develop platforms or networks that disintermediate us from digital payments and impact our ability to compete in the digital economy.

This risk is heightened when we have relationships with these entities where we share Mastercard data.

While we share this data in a controlled manner subject to applicable anonymization and privacy and data standards, without proper oversight we could inadvertently share too much data which could give the partner a competitive advantage.

• Competitors, customers, technology companies, governments and other industry participants may develop products that compete with or replace value-added products and services we currently provide to support our switched transaction and payment offerings.

These products could replace our own switching and payments offerings or could force us to change our pricing or practices for these offerings.

The payments markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, new product introductions, evolving industry standards and changing customer and consumer needs.

In order to remain competitive and meet the needs of the payments market, we are continually involved in diversifying our integrated products and services.

These efforts carry the risks associated with any diversification initiative, including cost overruns, delays in delivery and performance problems.

These projects also carry risks associated with working with different types of customers, for example organizations such as corporations that are not financial 24 MASTERCARD 2019 FORM 10-K PART I ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS institutions and non-governmental organizations (“NGOs”), and end users other than those we have traditionally worked with.

These differences may present new operational challenges in the development and implementation of our new products or services.

Our failure to render these integrated products and services could make our other integrated products and services less desirable to customers, or put us at a competitive disadvantage.

As a result, information security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us.

As cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.

Damage to our reputation or that of our brands resulting from an account data breach of either our systems or the systems of our customers, merchants and other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our integrated products and services.

Such events could also slow or reverse the trend toward MASTERCARD 2019 FORM 10-K 25 PART I ITEM 1A.

This may also allow these processors to commoditize the data that are included in the transactions.

If our customers are disintermediated in their business, we could face diminished demand for our integrated products and services.

•Although we partner with fintechs and technology companies (such as digital players and mobile providers) that leverage our technology, platforms and networks to deliver their products, they could develop platforms or networks that disintermediate us from digital payments and impact our ability to compete in the digital economy.

This risk is heightened when we have relationships with these entities where we share Mastercard data.

While we share this data in a controlled manner subject to applicable anonymization and privacy and data standards, without proper oversight we could give the partner a competitive advantage.

•Competitors, customers, fintechs, technology companies, governments and other industry participants may develop products that compete with or replace value-added products and services we currently provide to support our switched transaction and payment offerings.

These products could replace our own switching and payments offerings or could force us to change our pricing or practices for these offerings.

Despite various mitigation efforts that we undertake, there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer material breaches and resulting losses in the future, or that our insurance coverage would be sufficient to cover all losses.

Our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, our prominent size and scale and our role in the global payments and technology industries, our plans to continue to implement our digital and mobile channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers and account holders when and how they want to be served, our global presence, our extensive use of third-party vendors and future joint venture and merger and acquisition opportunities.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy, including the significant increase in unemployment, we experienced a material increase in new defaults in the second quarter of 2020, and to a lesser extent in the second half of 2020, substantially all related to defaulted loans subject to forbearance programs implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

While we expect it will take a number of months or years before any new defaults resulting from the pandemic would require a claim payment, Radian Group may be required to contribute additional capital to support Radian Guaranty's PMIERs Cushion due to increased minimum asset requirements on defaulted loans.
