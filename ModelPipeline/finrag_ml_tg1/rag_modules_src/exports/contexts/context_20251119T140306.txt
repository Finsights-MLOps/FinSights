In discussing our operating results, we use the term "currency exchange rates" to refer to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.

We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates from the prior period to the current period as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates, and current period activity translated using the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates.

Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future.

The Retail Industry We operate in the highly competitive retail industry in all of the markets we serve.

We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses.

Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international online presence.

We compete with a number of companies for prime retail site locations, as well as in attracting and retaining quality employees ("associates").

We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment.

Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found herein under "Item 1A.

Risk Factors," and under "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."

Company Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs.

At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate.

Our financial framework is defined as: • strong, efficient growth; • operating discipline; and • strategic capital allocation.

A number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters.

Walmex is cooperating with the Mexican governmental agencies conducting these investigations.

Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by several of the Company's shareholders against it, certain of its current directors, and certain of its former directors, certain of its former officers and certain of Walmex's former officers.

The Company could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of the matters noted above.

There could be one or more enforcement actions in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties and the shareholder lawsuits referenced above may result in judgments against the Company and its current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings.

The Company expects that there will be on-going media and governmental interest, including additional news articles from media publications on these matters, which could impact the perception among certain audiences of the Company's role as a corporate citizen.

In addition, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits, and in conducting the review and investigations.

We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates.

Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months.

Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future.

Our business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns.

Generally, our highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.

We made certain strategic portfolio decisions, further discussed in Item 1. Business, which include the following: • Acquisition of 81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart Private Limited ("Flipkart") in August 2018.

In the future, if the held for sale classification criteria is met for the disposal group, we expect to recognize a loss, the amount of which may fluctuate based on the changes in the value of share capital received and foreign exchange rates.

• Divestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil to Advent International ("Advent") in August 2018, for which we recorded a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion in fiscal 2019.

• Divestiture of banking operations in Walmart Chile in December 2018 and the proposed divestiture of banking operations in Walmart Canada, classified as held for sale as of January 31, 2019.

The Retail Industry We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve.

We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses.

Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence.

We also compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees ("associates").

We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment.
