Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash flows used in financing activities generally consist of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, financing obligations, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock.

Transactions with noncontrolling interests are also classified as cash flows from financing activities.

Net cash used in financing activities increased $0.8 billion and $2.8 billion for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.

Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2018 increased due to premiums paid for early extinguishment of debt.

Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2017 increased primarily due to repurchases of Company stock partially offset by lower repayments of long-term debt.

Further discussion of financing activities is provided by major category below.

Short-term Borrowings Net cash flows provided by short-term borrowings increased $4.1 billion in fiscal 2018 and decreased $1.7 billion in fiscal 2017, when compared to the balance at the end of the previous fiscal year.

Refer to Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on our acquisition of jet.com and investment in JD.

Additionally, refer to the "Strategic Capital Allocation" section in our Company Performance Metrics for capital expenditure detail for fiscal 2019 and 2018.

Growth Activities For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2020 ("fiscal 2020"), we project capital expenditures will be approximately $11.0 billion.

In fiscal 2020, we expect to add approximately 300 new stores in Walmart International, primarily in Mexico, Central America and China, and add less than 10 stores in Walmart U.S. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, financing obligations, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock.

Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities.

Fiscal 2019 net cash used in financing activities decreased $17.3 billion when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.

The decrease was primarily due to the $15.9 billion of net proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt to fund a portion of the purchase price for Flipkart and for general corporate purposes, as well as a decrease in share repurchases due to the suspension of repurchases in anticipation of the Flipkart announcement.

We generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash requirements.

For fiscal 2018, the additional cash provided by short-term borrowings was primarily due to the timing of our January 2018 debt extinguishment.

The following table includes additional information related to the Company's short-term borrowings for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017: In addition to our short-term borrowings, we have $15.0 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S. and approximately $2.8 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit outside of the U.S., as of January 31, 2019, that provide additional liquidity, if needed.

Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for fiscal 2019: Our total long-term debt increased $11.6 billion for fiscal 2019, primarily due to the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt to fund a portion of the purchase price for Flipkart and for general corporate purposes.

Dividends Our total dividend payments were $6.1 billion, $6.1 billion and $6.2 billion for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

The Board of Directors approved, effective February 19, 2019, the fiscal 2020 annual dividend of $2.12 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2019 annual dividend of $2.08 per share.

For fiscal 2020, the annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.53 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: Company Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors.


=== [WMT] Walmart Inc. | FY 2020 | Doc: 0000104169_10-K_2020 | Item 7: Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) | Sentences: 0000104169_10-K_2020_section_7_102 - 0000104169_10-K_2020_section_7_229 ===

Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.

See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.

We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period.

We had net cash provided by operating activities of $25.3 billion, $27.8 billion and $28.3 billion for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

We generated free cash flow of $14.6 billion, $17.4 billion and $18.3 billion for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020 declined when compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the contribution to our Asda pension plan in anticipation of its future settlement, the inclusion of a full year of Flipkart operations, and the timing of vendor payments.

Free cash flow for fiscal 2020 declined when compared to fiscal 2019 due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.4 billion in increased capital expenditures.

Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from the Tax Act and the timing of tax payments.

Free cash flow for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to fiscal 2018 due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.3 billion in increased capital expenditures.

Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions.

Our total revenues, which includes net sales and membership and other income, increased $9.6 billion or 1.9% and $14.1 billion or 2.8% for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.

These increases in revenues were due to increases in net sales, which increased $9.6 billion or 1.9% and $14.6 billion or 2.9% for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.

For fiscal 2020, net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, along with the addition of net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in August 2018, and positive comparable sales in the majority of our international markets.

These increases were partially offset by $4.1 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates in fiscal 2020 and our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in August 2018.

For fiscal 2019, net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, along with positive comparable sales in the majority of our International markets and net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.

Additionally, for fiscal 2019, the increase in net sales was partially offset by a $4.5 billion decrease in net sales due to club closures in the Sam's Club segment during fiscal 2018, a $3.1 billion reduction in net sales due to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in the International segment, and $0.7 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

Our gross profit rate decreased 40 and 18 basis points for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.

For fiscal 2020, these decreases were primarily due to price investment in the Walmart U.S. segment and the addition of Flipkart in the Walmart International segment, partially offset by favorable merchandise mix including strength in private brands and less pressure from transportation costs in the Walmart U.S. segment.

For fiscal 2019, the decrease was due to the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business, the acquisition of Flipkart, our planned pricing strategy and increased transportation expenses.

For fiscal 2020, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 8 basis points, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to our focus on expense management combined with our growth in comparable store sales.

These improvements were partially offset by $0.9 billion in business restructuring charges consisting primarily of non-cash impairment charges for certain trade names, acquired developed technology, and other business restructuring charges due to strategic decisions that resulted in the write down of certain assets in the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments.

The loss in fiscal 2019 is primarily the result of the $4.8 billion pre-tax loss on the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil and a $3.5 billion decrease in the market value of our investment in JD.com.

Fiscal 2018 results included loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.1 billion.

Our effective income tax rate was 24.4% for fiscal 2020, 37.4% for fiscal 2019, and 30.4% for fiscal 2018.

The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 is primarily due to the fiscal 2019 loss on sale of a majority stake in Walmart Brazil, which increased the comparative period's effective tax rate, as it provided minimal realizable tax benefit.

The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 is primarily due to the aforementioned loss on sale of a majority stake in Walmart Brazil and Flipkart's results.

Additionally, our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of various factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that, beginning in fiscal 2019, are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate.

The reconciliation from the U.S. statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 is presented in Note 9 to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

These improvements more than offset investments in eCommerce, technology and omni-channel initiatives and raising the starting wage rate at the beginning of fiscal 2019.

As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $6 million and increased $391 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.

Walmart International Segment Net sales for the Walmart International segment decreased $0.7 billion or 0.6% and increased $2.8 billion or 2.3% for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.

For fiscal 2020, the decrease was primarily due to negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $4.1 billion as well as a reduction in sales due to our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in August 2018, offset by a full year of net sales from Flipkart and positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets.

For fiscal 2019, the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.

These increases were partially offset by a $3.1 billion reduction in net sales due to our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, a $0.7 billion negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the continued wind down of our first party Brazil eCommerce operations and a reduction in net sales of $140 million due to divesting our Suburbia business in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.

Gross profit rate decreased 136 and 41 basis points for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.

Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases.

We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global investment and expansion activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $25.3 billion, $27.8 billion and $28.3 billion for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020 decreased when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to the contribution to our Asda pension plan in anticipation of its future settlement, the inclusion of a full year of Flipkart operations, and the timing of vendor payments.

The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019, when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from Tax Reform and the timing of tax payments.

Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit Cash and cash equivalents were $9.5 billion and $7.7 billion as of January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Our working capital deficit, defined as total current assets less total current liabilities, was $16.0 billion and $15.6 billion as of January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

We also expect to add approximately 250 new stores in Walmart International, primarily in Mexico and China.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, financing obligations, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock.

Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities.

Fiscal 2020 net cash used in financing activities increased $11.8 billion when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.

The increase was primarily due to the $15.9 billion of net proceeds received in the prior year from the issuance of long-term debt to fund a portion of the purchase price for Flipkart partially offset by $5.5 billion of additional long-term debt in the current year to fund general business operations.

Fiscal 2019 net cash used in financing activities decreased $17.3 billion for fiscal 2019 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.

The decrease was primarily due to the $15.9 billion of net proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt to fund a portion of the purchase price for Flipkart and for general corporate purposes, as well as a decrease in share repurchases due to the suspension of repurchases in anticipation of the Flipkart announcement.

Short-term Borrowings Net cash flows used in short-term borrowings increased in fiscal 2020 and were relatively flat in fiscal 2019.

We generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash requirements.

For fiscal 2020, the additional cash used in short-term borrowings was primarily due to long-term debt issuances being used to pay down short-term borrowings.

The following table includes additional information related to the Company's short-term borrowings for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018: In addition to our short-term borrowings, we have $15.0 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S. and approximately $2.9 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit outside of the U.S., as of January 31, 2020, that provide additional liquidity, if needed.

Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for fiscal 2020: Our total long-term debt increased $3.7 billion for fiscal 2020, primarily due to the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt in both April 2019 and September 2019 to fund general business operations, partially offset by repayments of long-term debt.

Dividends Our total dividend payments were $6.0 billion, $6.1 billion and $6.1 billion for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

The Board of Directors approved, effective February 18, 2020, the fiscal 2021 annual dividend of $2.16 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2020 annual dividend of $2.12 per share.

For fiscal 2021, the annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.54 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: Company Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors.
