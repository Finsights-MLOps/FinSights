Derivative Financial Instruments Cash Flow Hedges In November 2015, we implemented a program to hedge the foreign currency exposure risk related to certain forecasted inventory purchases denominated in Japanese yen.

The derivative instruments we use are foreign currency forward contracts and are designated as cash flow hedges with maturity dates of 12 months or less.

We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes.

The bank counterparties in all contracts expose Tesla to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance.

However, to mitigate that risk, Tesla only contracts with counterparties who meet the Company’s minimum requirements under its counterparty risk assessment process.

Tesla monitors ratings, credit spreads, and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis.

Based on our on-going assessment of counterparty risk, the Company will adjust its exposure to various counterparties.

Dividend Policy We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock.

We currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

Any future determination to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.

Stock Performance Graph This performance graph shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or incorporated by reference into any filing of Tesla, Inc. under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

The following graph shows a comparison, from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2018, of the cumulative total return on our common stock, The NASDAQ Composite Index and a group of all public companies sharing the same SIC code as us, which is SIC code 3711, “Motor Vehicles and Passenger Car Bodies” (Motor Vehicles and Passenger Car Bodies Public Company Group).

Such returns are based on historical results and are not intended to suggest future performance.

Data for The NASDAQ Composite Index and the Motor Vehicles and Passenger Car Bodies Public Company Group assumes an investment of $100 on January 1, 2014 and reinvestment of dividends.

Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

Revenue Recognition Adoption of new revenue standard On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (“new revenue standard”) using the modified retrospective method.

The new revenue standard had a material impact in our consolidated financial statements.

For further discussion, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Automotive Segment Automotive Sales Revenue Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under the new revenue standard, including access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot, full self-driving and over-the-air software updates.

We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers.

Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.

These increases were partially offset by a decrease in cost of powertrain sales to another automobile manufacturer as we wound down the program in 2017.

Gross margin for total automotive remained relatively consistent at 23% in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

There were increases from improved Model S and Model X combined margins as costs per unit decreased year-over-year from continuing manufacturing efficiencies and an increase in regulatory credits sales, which have no associated costs.

The increases were partially offset by margin dilution from Model 3 despite Model 3 margins improving year-over-year.

The higher proportion of Model 3 as a percentage of our total automotive sales in the year ended December 31, 2018 lowered our overall gross margin for total automotive as Model 3 had a lower annualized margin than Model S and Model X due to temporary under-utilization of manufacturing capacity at lower production volumes in the first half of 2018 and as we have yet to achieve significant manufacturing efficiencies in the production of Model 3.

Gross margin for total automotive & services and other segment remained relatively consistent at 19% in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 primarily due to the automotive gross margin impacts discussed above.

Services and other has historically operated at lower margins than our automotive sales and leasing business but has a small impact on the overall segment margin because of its relatively small revenue base.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a location-by-location level from time to time to optimize our current sales channels.

Sales of vehicles in the automobile industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to volatility from time to time.

Used Vehicle Sales Our used vehicle business supports new vehicle sales by integrating the sale of a new Tesla vehicle with a customer’s trade-in needs for their existing Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles.

The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire through trade-ins are subsequently remarketed, either directly by us or through third-parties.

We also receive used Tesla vehicles to resell through lease returns and other sources.

Public Charging We continue to build out our global Supercharger network for our customers’ convenience, including to enable long-distance travel and urban ownership, which is a part of our strategy to remove a barrier to the broader adoption of electric vehicles caused by the perception of limited range.

Each Tesla Supercharger is an industrial grade, high-speed charger designed to recharge a Tesla vehicle significantly more quickly than other charging options, and we continue to evolve our technology to allow for even faster charging times at lower cost to us.

Automotive Segment Automotive Sales Revenue Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and pay-per-use charges, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under the new revenue standard, including access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot, FSD features and over-the-air software updates.

We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers.

Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.

The deliveries in the year ended December 31, 2019 were at lower average selling prices than the prior year due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings and the introduction of lower end Model 3 trims in 2019.

Due to the price adjustments, we estimated that there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback options that were provided prior to such adjustments.

As a result, along with the estimated variable consideration related to normal future product returns for vehicles sold under the buyback options program, we adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program resulting in a reduction of automotive sales revenues of $555 million.

Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Automotive leasing revenue decreased $14 million, or 2%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.

The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cumulative vehicles under our resale value guarantee leasing programs which are accounted for as operating leases.

The decrease was partially offset by an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct vehicle leasing program, partially due to the introduction of Model 3 direct leasing in the second quarter of 2019.

The increases were partially offset by a decrease of 30,487 Model S and Model X cash deliveries and a decrease in average Model 3 costs per unit compared to the prior year primarily due to lower end trims introduced in 2019 and temporary under-utilization of manufacturing capacity at lower production volumes in the first half of 2018.

Additionally, due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings in 2019, we estimated that there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback options that were provided prior to such adjustments.

If customers elect to exercise the buyback options, we expect to be able to subsequently resell the returned vehicles, which resulted in a reduction of automotive cost of sales of $451 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Cost of automotive leasing revenue decreased $29 million, or 6%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.

The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cumulative vehicles under our resale value guarantee leasing programs which are accounted for as operating leases.

The decrease was partially offset by an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct vehicle leasing program, partially due to the introduction of Model 3 leasing in the second quarter of 2019.

Automotive leasing revenue increased $183 million, or 21%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and the introduction of direct sales-type leasing programs which we began offering in volume during the third quarter of 2020 where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer.

These increases were partially offset by the decreases in automotive leasing revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined.

Services and other revenue increased $80 million, or 4%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow, an increase in retail merchandise revenue and an increase in sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers as we had a partial year of sales in the prior year from our mid-year 2019 acquisitions.

These increases were partially offset by a decrease in used vehicle revenue driven by a reduction in non-Tesla trade-ins.

Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products, services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives.

2020 compared to 2019 Energy generation and storage revenue increased by $463 million, or 30%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to increases in deployments of Megapack, solar cash and loan jobs and Powerwall, partially offset by a decrease in deployments of Powerpack and reduced average selling prices on our solar cash and loan jobs as a result of our low cost solar strategy.

Powerpack deployments have decreased following the introduction of our Megapack product, which we began deploying in late 2019.
