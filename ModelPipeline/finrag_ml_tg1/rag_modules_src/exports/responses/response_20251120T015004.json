  "query": "Over time, how does Meta Platforms describe the regulatory and policy risks that could affect its advertising business and use of data, including anti-corruption laws, privacy rules and emerging AI frameworks?",
  "answer": "# Meta's Evolving Regulatory and Policy Risk Landscape\n\nMeta Platforms has consistently faced an expanding and increasingly complex web of regulatory risks affecting its advertising business and data practices, with the company's risk disclosures growing more detailed and urgent from 2016 through 2020.\n\n## Core Regulatory Framework: Privacy and Data Protection\n\nThroughout the 2016-2020 period, Meta emphasized that it operates under \"complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use and data protection, content, competition, consumer protection, and other matters\" [META, FY 2016-2020, Item 1A: Risk Factors]. The company consistently noted that foreign data protection and privacy laws \"can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States\" [META, FY 2016-2020, Item 1A: Risk Factors].\n\nBy 2020, Meta's regulatory landscape had become significantly more specific and burdensome. The company identified several major regulatory developments directly impacting its operations:\n\n**GDPR and European Regulations**: The General Data Protection Regulation fundamentally altered Meta's European operations. The company reported that \"we have seen an increasing number of users opt out of certain types of ad targeting in Europe following adoption of the GDPR\" [META, FY 2020, Item 1A: Risk Factors]. Additionally, the ePrivacy Directive, effective December 2020, imposed \"additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and includes significant penalties for non-compliance\" [META, FY 2020, Item 1: Business].\n\n**U.S. State-Level Privacy Laws**: The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which took effect in January 2020, \"establishes certain transparency rules and creates new data privacy rights for users\" [META, FY 2020, Item 1: Business]. Meta noted implementing \"product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in California following adoption of the CCPA\" [META, FY 2020, Item 1A: Risk Factors].\n\n**Global Expansion**: The Brazilian General Data Protection Law \"recently took effect and imposes data privacy-related requirements similar to GDPR on products and services offered to users in Brazil\" [META, FY 2020, Item 1: Business].\n\n## Direct Impact on Advertising Revenue\n\nMeta became increasingly explicit about how regulatory changes directly harm its core business model. The company stated that its \"advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control, and changes to the regulatory environment, third-party mobile operating systems and browsers, and our own products have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, the availability of such signals, which will adversely affect our advertising revenue\" [META, FY 2019-2020, Item 1A: Risk Factors].\n\nSpecifically, Meta acknowledged that legislative and regulatory developments \"have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products\" and that \"some of these changes will reduce marketers' ability to effectively target their ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business\" [META, FY 2018-2020, Item 1A: Risk Factors].\n\n## Compliance Costs and Operational Constraints\n\nThe regulatory burden extended beyond revenue impacts to operational complexity. Meta disclosed being \"subject to investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits by government authorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumer protection, and competition\" [META, FY 2020, Item 1: Business].\n\nThe company noted that compliance efforts \"will increase demand on our systems and resources, and will require significant investments, including investments in compliance processes, personnel, and technical infrastructure\" [META, FY 2019, Item 1A: Risk Factors]. These efforts were expected to \"make some practices such as product and ads development more difficult, time-consuming, and costly\" and would \"adversely affect\" the company's \"ability to develop and launch new features, products, and services in a timely manner\" [META, FY 2019, Item 1A: Risk Factors].\n\n## Data Localization and Cross-Border Transfer Risks\n\nMeta identified emerging risks around data sovereignty, noting that \"some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services\" [META, FY 2020, Item 1: Business]. The company specifically warned about \"limitations on our ability to operate material portions of our business in Europe as a result of European regulators, courts, or legislative bodies determining that our reliance on SCCs or other legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States is invalid\" [META, FY 2020, Item 1A: Risk Factors].\n\n## Anti-Corruption and Broader Compliance\n\nWhile privacy dominated the regulatory discussion, Meta also acknowledged exposure to \"economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance, securities law compliance\" [META, FY 2020, Item 1: Business]. The company noted potential risks from \"the Chinese government\" taking \"action that reduces or eliminates our China-based advertising revenue, whether as a result of the trade dispute with the United States, in response to content issues or information requests in Hong Kong or elsewhere, or for other reasons, or take other action against us, such as imposing taxes or other penalties\" [META, FY 2020, Item 1A: Risk Factors].\n\n## Emerging Technology Frameworks: AI and Content\n\nBy 2020, Meta began acknowledging regulatory attention to artificial intelligence, listing \"artificial intelligence\" among the regulatory matters affecting its business [META, FY 2020, Item 1: Business]. The company also noted increased reliance on AI for content moderation during COVID-19, acknowledging \"adverse impacts to our efforts to combat misuse of our products and services and user data as a result of limitations on our safety, security, and content review efforts while our workforce is working remotely, such as the necessity to rely more heavily on artificial intelligence\" [META, FY 2020, Item 1A: Risk Factors].\n\n## Reputational and Brand Risks\n\nMeta connected regulatory scrutiny to broader reputational damage, noting that \"media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, advertising, competition, and other issues\" has \"adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our reputation and brands\" [META, FY 2020, Item 1A: Risk Factors]. The company specifically referenced the March 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal as an example of how \"misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies\" created lasting regulatory and reputational consequences [META, FY 2018-2020, Item 1A: Risk Factors].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFrom 2016 to 2020, Meta's regulatory risk profile evolved from general acknowledgment of privacy laws to detailed disclosure of specific regulations (GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy Directive) that were actively reducing advertising effectiveness and requiring substantial operational changes. The company became increasingly transparent about the direct financial impact of these regulations on its core advertising business, while also acknowledging that the regulatory environment would continue to evolve in ways that would further constrain its data practices and business model.",

evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business.\n\nThese laws and regulations involve matters including privacy, data use, data protection and personal information, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, artificial intelligence, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation,

state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of people's data.\n\nForeign data protection, privacy, content, competition, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States.\n\nThese U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change.\n\nThe Brazilian General Data Protection Law recently took effect and imposes data privacy-related requirements similar to GDPR on products and services offered to users in Brazil.\n\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act, which took effect in January 2020, also establishes certain transparency rules and creates new data privacy rights for users.\n\nIn addition, effective December 2020, the European Union's ePrivacy Directive includes additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and includes significant penalties for non-compliance.\n\nChanges to our products or business practices as a result of these developments may adversely affect our advertising business.\n\nSimilarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for copyright infringement.\n\nIn addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.\n\nWe are, and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits by government authorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumer protection, and competition, as we continue to grow and expand our operations.\n\n\n=== [META] Facebook Inc | FY 2020 | Doc:

determining that our reliance on SCCs or other legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States is invalid;\n\nOur advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control, and changes to the regulatory environment, third-party mobile operating systems and browsers, and our own products have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, the availability of such signals, which will adversely affect our advertising revenue.\n\nWe rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users.\n\nOur advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate these signals, and any changes in our ability to use such signals will adversely affect our business.\n\nFor example, legislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, and CCPA, have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products.\n\nIn particular, we have seen an increasing number of users opt out of certain types of ad targeting in Europe following adoption of the GDPR, and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in California following adoption of the CCPA.\n\nRegulatory guidance or decisions or new legislation may require us to make additional changes to our products in the future that further reduce our ability to use these signals.\n\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have announced product changes as well as future plans to limit the ability of application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising.\n\nWe may introduce new\n\nproducts or terms of service or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands.\n\nAdditionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party mobile and web applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products.\n\nWe will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, advertising, competition, and other issues, including actions or decisions in connection with elections or the COVID-19 pandemic, which has in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our reputation and brands.\n\nFor example, in March 2018, we announced developments regarding the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies.\n\nWe also may fail to respond expeditiously or appropriately to the sharing of objectionable content on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers or developers, or to otherwise address user concerns, which has occurred in the past and which could erode confidence in our brands.\n\nOur brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users, by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities, by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading (or intended to manipulate opinions), by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for security-related purposes or to censor certain content on our platform, by the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends, including, for example, any such actions around the pandemic or elections in the United States and around the world, by decisions or recommendations regarding content on our platform from the independent Oversight Board, or by our decisions to remove content or suspend participation on our platform by persons who violate our community standards or terms of service.\n\n•decreased user engagement as a result of users' inability to purchase data packs or devices to access our products and services;\n\n•interruptions in the accessibility or performance of our products and services due to capacity constraints from increased usage, or product changes we implement to maintain accessibility of our services, such as reducing the quality of video to reduce bandwidth usage;\n\n•delays in product development or releases, or reductions in manufacturing production and sales of consumer hardware, as a result of inventory shortages, supply chain or labor shortages, or diversion of our efforts and resources to projects related to COVID-19;\n\n•increased misuse of our products and services or user data by third parties, including improper advertising practices or other activity inconsistent with our terms, contracts, or policies, misinformation or other illicit or objectionable material on our platforms, election interference, or other undesirable activity;\n\n•adverse impacts to our efforts to combat misuse of our products and services and user data as a result of limitations on our safety, security, and content review efforts while our workforce is working remotely, such as the necessity to rely more heavily on artificial intelligence to perform tasks that our workforce is unable to perform;\n\n•our inability to recognize revenue, collect payment, or generate future revenue from marketers, including from those that have been or may be forced to close their businesses or are otherwise impacted by the economic downturn;\n\n•increased expenses resulting from our initiatives or donations related to the pandemic;\n\nWe cannot guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.\n\nThe program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock.\n\nIn addition, this program will diminish our cash reserves.\n\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement Actions by governments that restrict access to Facebook or our other products in their countries, or that otherwise impair our ability to sell advertising in their countries, could substantially harm our business and financial results.\n\nGovernments from time to time seek to censor content available on Facebook or our other products in their country, restrict access to our products from their country entirely, or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely.\n\nFor example, user access to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in China, Iran, and North Korea.\n\nIn addition, government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws or a threat to public safety or for other reasons, and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in other countries from time to time.\n\nFor example, we generate meaningful revenue from a limited number of resellers representing advertisers based in China, and it is possible that the Chinese government could take action that reduces or eliminates our China-based advertising revenue, whether as a result of the trade dispute with the United States, in response to content issues or information requests in Hong Kong or elsewhere, or for other reasons, or take other action against us, such as imposing taxes or other penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results.\n\nSimilarly, if we are found to be out of compliance with certain legal requirements for social media companies in Turkey, the Turkish government could take action to reduce or eliminate our Turkey-based advertising revenue or otherwise adversely impact access to our products.\n\nIn the event that content shown on Facebook or our other products is subject to censorship, access to our products is restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries, we are required to or elect to make changes to our operations, or other restrictions are imposed on our products, or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions, our ability to retain or increase our user base, user engagement, or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated, and our financial results could be adversely affected.\n\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use and data protection, content, competition, consumer protection, and other matters.\n\nMany of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\n\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including privacy, data use, data protection and personal information, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, artificial intelligence, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services.\n\nThe introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny.\n\nIn addition, foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States.\n\nThese U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change.\n\nThese laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our advertising services, or reductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business.\n\nFor example, regulators have recently issued new guidance concerning the ePrivacy Directive's requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies.\n\nIn addition, effective December 2020, the ePrivacy Directive includes additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and includes significant penalties for non-compliance.\n\nChanges to our products or business practices as a result of these developments may adversely affect our advertising business.\n\nSimilarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business.\n\nIn addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.\n\nThese laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any other government actions, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs, delays or impediments in the development of new products, negative publicity and reputational harm, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, and remedies that harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\n\nWe do not have significant prior experience with blockchain-based payments technology, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and services.\n\nWe will also incur increased costs in connection with our participation in the Diem Association and the development and marketing of associated products and services, and our investments may not be successful.\n\nAny of these events could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\nRisks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual Property Security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, or other cyber incidents could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\n\nOur industry is prone to cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users' data or to disrupt our ability to provide service.\n\nOur products and services involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of a large amount of data.\n\nAny failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, including personal information, content, or payment information from users, or information from marketers, could result in the loss, modification, disclosure, destruction, or other misuse of such data, which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position.\n\n•price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\n•the inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our stock from any trading indices, such as the S&P 500 Index;\n\n•media coverage of our business and financial performance; •lawsuits threatened or filed against us, or developments in pending lawsuits;\n\n•adverse government actions or legislative or regulatory developments relating to advertising, competition, content, privacy, or other matters, including interim or final rulings by tax, judicial, or regulatory bodies;\n\n•trading activity in our share repurchase program; and •other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, and other disruptive external events, or responses to these events.\n\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies.\n\nWe are currently subject to securities litigation in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, as well as the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018.\n\n\n=== [META] Meta Platforms, Inc. | FY 2016 | Doc: 0001326801_10-K_2016 | Item 1A: Risk Factors | Sentences:

us.\n\nMarketers will not continue to do business with us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us, if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner, or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives.\n\nWe have recently implemented, and we may continue to implement, changes to our user data practices.\n\nSome of these changes will reduce marketers’ ability to effectively target their ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business.\n\nIf we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment, the pricing of our ads may not increase, or may decline, in which case our revenue and financial results may be harmed.\n\nOur advertising revenue could also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including: • decreases in user engagement, including time spent on our products; • our inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products; • product changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size, format, frequency, or relative prominence of ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our products; • our inability to maintain or increase marketer demand, the pricing of our ads, or both; • our inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users, including as a result of technical infrastructure constraints; • user behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize, including as a result of our efforts to promote the Stories format or increased usage of our messaging products; • reductions of advertising by marketers due to our efforts to implement advertising policies that protect the security and integrity of our platform; • changes to third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver or target advertising; • the availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools; • loss of advertising market share to our competitors, including if prices to purchase our ads increase or if competitors offer lower priced, more integrated or otherwise more effective products; • adverse government actions or legal developments relating to advertising, including legislative and regulatory developments and developments in litigation; • decisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of adverse media reports or other negative publicity involving us, our user data practices, our advertising metrics or tools, content on our products, developers with mobile and web applications that are integrated with our products, or other companies in our industry; • reductions of advertising by marketers due to objectionable content published on our products by third parties, questions about our user data practices, concerns about brand safety, or uncertainty regarding their own legal and compliance obligations; • the effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which users opt out of certain types of ad targeting, including as a result of product changes and controls that we implemented in connection with the GDPR, other similar changes that we implemented in the United States and around the world, or other product changes or controls we may implement in the future, whether in connection with other regulations, regulatory actions or otherwise, that impact our ability to target ads; • the degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they engage with our ads; • changes in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced; • changes in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base; and • the impact of macroeconomic conditions, whether in the advertising industry in general, or among specific types of marketers or within particular geographies.\n\nThe occurrence of any of these or other factors could result in a reduction in demand for our ads, which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads, or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether, either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial results.\n\nWe make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\n\nWe frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term.\n\nFor example, we have recently implemented, and we may continue to implement, changes to our user data practices.\n\nSome of these changes will reduce marketers’ ability to effectively target their ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business.\n\nSimilarly, we previously announced changes to our News Feed ranking algorithm to help our users have more meaningful interactions, and these changes have had, and we expect will continue to have, the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with Facebook, which could adversely affect our financial results.\n\nFrom time to time, we may also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads in order to improve ad quality and overall user experience.\n\nIn addition, we have made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on Facebook.\n\nMaintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do successfully.\n\nWe may introduce new products or terms of service or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands.\n\nAdditionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party mobile and web applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products.\n\nWe will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, content, advertising, and other issues, including actions or decisions in connection with elections, which may adversely affect our reputation and brands.\n\nFor example, we previously announced our discovery of certain ads and other content previously displayed on our products that may be relevant to government investigations relating to Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nIn addition, in March 2018, we announced developments regarding the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies.\n\nWe also may fail to respond expeditiously or appropriately to the sharing of objectionable content on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers or developers, or to otherwise address user concerns, which could erode confidence in our brands.\n\nIn future periods in which our stock price is lower than the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that period, our effective tax rate may increase.\n\nThe amount and value of share-based compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of share-based compensation on our effective tax rate.\n\nThese tax effects are dependent on our stock price, which we do not control, and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results.\n\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, content, competition, consumer protection, and other matters.\n\nMany of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\n\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including privacy, data protection and personal information, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, securities law compliance, and online payment services.\n\nThe introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny.\n\nIn addition, foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States.\n\n\n=== [META] Meta Platforms, Inc. | FY 2019 | Doc: 0001326801_10-K_2019 | Item 1A: Risk Factors | Sentences: 0001326801_10-K_2019_section_1A_33 - 0001326801_10-K_2019_section_1A_230 ===\n\nOur advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control, and changes to the regulatory environment, third-party mobile operating systems and browsers, and our own products have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, the availability of such signals, which will adversely affect our advertising revenue.\n\nWe rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users.\n\nOur advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate these signals, and any changes in our ability to use such signals will adversely affect our business.\n\nFor example, legislative and regulatory changes, such as the GDPR and CCPA, have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products.\n\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have announced product changes as well as future plans to limit the ability of application developers to use these signals to target and measure advertising on their platforms.\n\nSimilarly, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, product changes that give users the ability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services, including our Off-Facebook Activity tool and our worldwide offering of product changes we implemented in connection with the GDPR.\n\nThese developments have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform, and any additional loss of such signals in the future will adversely affect our targeting and measurement capabilities and negatively impact our advertising revenue.\n\nMaintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do successfully.\n\nWe may introduce new products or terms of service or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands.\n\nAdditionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party mobile and web applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products.\n\nWe will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, encryption, content, advertising, and other issues, including actions or decisions in connection with elections, which may adversely affect our reputation and brands.\n\nFor example, in March 2018, we announced developments regarding the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies.\n\nWe also may fail to respond expeditiously or appropriately to the sharing of objectionable content on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers or developers, or to otherwise address user concerns, which has occurred in the past and which could erode confidence in our brands.\n\nOur brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users, by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities, by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading (or intended to manipulate opinions), by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for security-related purposes or to censor certain content on our platform, or by the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends, including, for example, any such actions around the 2020 U.S. presidential election or other elections around the world.\n\nIn future periods in which our stock price is lower than the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that period, our effective tax rate may increase.\n\nThe amount and value of share-based compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of share-based compensation on our effective tax rate.\n\nThese tax effects are dependent on our stock price, which we do not control, and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results.\n\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, content, competition, consumer protection, and other matters.\n\nMany of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\n\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including privacy, data protection and personal information, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, anti-corruption law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services.\n\nThe introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny.\n\nIn addition, foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States.\n\nWe expect that these enhancements will result in both improved privacy compliance and oversight and the discovery of additional privacy issues, at least in the near-term, and we expect to continue to notify the FTC of such issues from time to time in accordance with our reporting obligations under the consent order.\n\nThese compliance and oversight efforts will increase demand on our systems and resources, and will require significant investments, including investments in compliance processes, personnel, and technical infrastructure.\n\nIn the near-term, we are reallocating resources internally to assist with these efforts, and this has had, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on our other business initiatives.\n\nIn addition, these efforts will require substantial modifications to our business practices and make some practices such as product and ads development more difficult, time-consuming, and costly.\n\nAs a result, we believe our ability to develop and launch new features, products, and services in a timely manner will be adversely affected.\n\nWe also expect that our privacy compliance and oversight efforts will require significant time and attention from our management and board of directors.\n\nIn addition, regulatory and legislative privacy requirements are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change and uncertain interpretation.\n\n\n\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nUSER QUESTION\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nOver time, how
