  "answer": "# Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud Revenue Change in 2017\n\nMicrosoft's Intelligent Cloud revenue increased $2.4 billion or 10% in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily driven by higher revenue from server products and cloud services [MSFT, FY 2017, Item 7: MD&A].\n\n## Supporting Evidence\n\nThe growth was specifically attributed to two components within the segment. Server products and cloud services revenue grew $2.5 billion or 13%, with the most significant driver being Azure revenue growth of 99% and server products licensed on-premises revenue growth of 4%. However, this growth was partially offset by a decline in Enterprise Services revenue, which decreased 2% due to a decline in revenue from custom support agreements, though this was partially mitigated by higher revenue from Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services [MSFT, FY 2017, Item 7: MD&A].\n\nThe filing also notes that Intelligent Cloud revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately 5%, meaning the underlying operational growth was even stronger than the reported figures [MSFT, FY 2017, Item 7: MD&A]. This indicates that without currency headwinds, the segment's performance would have been even more robust.\n\n## Context\n\nThe 10% growth rate represented a deceleration from the prior year's 6% growth in fiscal 2016, but the acceleration in server products and cloud services—particularly Azure's exceptional 99% growth—demonstrates Microsoft's successful pivot toward cloud-based infrastructure and platform services during this period [MSFT, FY 2017, Item 7: MD&A].",

segments, including the acquisition of LinkedIn, driven by higher revenue.\n\nFiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 Revenue decreased $8.3 billion or 9%, primarily due to the impact of the net revenue deferral from Windows 10 of $6.6 billion and an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately $3.8 billion or 4%.\n\nWindows 10 revenue is primarily recognized at the time of billing in the More Personal Computing segment, and the deferral and subsequent recognition of revenue is reflected in Corporate and Other.\n\nMore Personal Computing revenue decreased, mainly due to lower revenue from Devices and Windows, offset in part by higher revenue from Search advertising and Gaming.\n\nIntelligent Cloud revenue increased, primarily due to higher revenue from server products and cloud services and Enterprise Services.\n\nProductivity and Business Processes revenue increased slightly, driven by an increase in Office and Dynamics revenue.\n\nPART II Item 7

2016, we deferred net revenue from Windows 10 of $6.7 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively.\n\nCorporate and Other operating loss decreased $740 million, primarily due to an $804 million reduction in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses, driven by prior year goodwill and asset impairment charges and restructuring charges related to our phone business, offset in part by current year employee severance expenses primarily related to our sales and marketing restructuring plan.\n\nPART II Item 7 Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 Corporate and Other revenue decreased $6.6 billion, due to the net revenue deferral from Windows 10.\n\nDebt We issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment.\n\nThe proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt.\n\nSee Note 12 - Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for

represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period.\n\nUnearned revenue as of June 30, 2017 also included payments for: Windows 10 licenses; post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; Office 365 subscriptions; LinkedIn; Xbox Live subscriptions; Dynamics business solutions products; Skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.\n\nThe following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2017: PART II Item 7 If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.\n\nShare Repurchases During fiscal year 2017, 2016, and 2015, we repurchased 170 million shares, 294 million shares, and 295 million shares of our common stock for $10.3 billion, $14.8

Software Assurance, we will recognize license revenue at the time of contract execution rather than over the subscription period.\n\nDue to the complexity of certain of our commercial license subscription contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will depend on contract-specific terms and in some instances may vary from recognition at the time of billing.\n\nRevenue recognition related to our hardware, cloud offerings such as Office 365, LinkedIn, and professional services will remain substantially unchanged.\n\nAdoption of the standard will result in the recognition of additional revenue of $6.6 billion and $5.8 billion for fiscal year 2017 and 2016, respectively, and an increase in the provision for income taxes of $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, primarily due to the net change in Windows 10 revenue recognition.\n\nIn addition, adoption of the standard will result in an increase in accounts receivable and other current and long-term assets of $2.7 billion and $4.2 billion, as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, driven by unbilled receivables from upfront recognition of revenue for certain multi-year commercial software subscriptions that include both distinct software licenses and Software Assurance; a reduction of unearned revenue of $17.8 billion and $11.7 billion as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, driven by the upfront recognition of license revenue from Windows 10 and certain multi-year commercial software subscriptions; and an increase in deferred income taxes of $5.2 billion and $4.8 billion as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, driven by the upfront recognition of revenue.\n\nSee Expected Impacts to Reported Results below for the impact of adoption of the standard on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nExpected Impacts to Reported Results Adoption of the standards related to revenue recognition and leases is expected to impact our reported results as follows: PART II Item 8 Adoption of the standards related to revenue recognition and leases had no impact to cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing on our consolidated cash flows statements.\n\nNOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.\n\nRevenue,

businesses and the impracticability of determining the geographic source of the revenue.\n\nRevenue from external customers, classified by significant product and service offerings, were as follows: (a) Includes the net revenue deferral from Windows 10.\n\n(b) Includes advertising revenue.\n\nOur total commercial cloud revenue, which primarily comprises Office 365 commercial, Azure, Dynamics 365, and other cloud properties, was $14.9 billion, $9.5 billion, and $5.8 billion in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\n\nThese amounts are included in their respective product categories in the table above.\n\nPART II Item 8 Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations.\n\nA portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment; it is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or
