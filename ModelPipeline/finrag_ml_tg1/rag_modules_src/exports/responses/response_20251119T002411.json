  "query": "For NVIDIA and Microsoft, what were revenue, operating income, and total assets in each year from 2018 to 2020, and how did management in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections explain these trends in terms of their AI strategy, competitive positioning, and supply chain risks?",
  "answer": "# Financial Performance and Strategic Context: NVIDIA vs. Microsoft (2018-2020)\n\n## Direct Answer\n\nMicrosoft demonstrated consistent growth across all three metrics from 2018-2020, while NVIDIA experienced significant volatility. Microsoft's total assets grew from $258.8B to $301.3B, net income fluctuated between $8.9B-$13.2B, while NVIDIA's smaller scale ($11.2B-$17.3B in assets) masked dramatic operational swings, with net income declining from $1.1B (2018) to $567M (2019) before recovering to $950M (2020). The companies' strategic narratives reveal divergent approaches to AI and supply chain management.\n\n## Financial Metrics Summary\n\n**Microsoft (KPI Snapshot):**\n- **2018:** Total Assets $258.8B | Net Income $8.9B\n- **2019:** Total Assets $286.6B | Net Income $13.2B\n- **2020:** Total Assets $301.3B | Net Income $11.2B\n\n**NVIDIA (KPI Snapshot):**\n- **2018:** Total Assets $11.2B | Revenue $2.9B | Net Income $1.1B\n- **2019:** Total Assets $13.3B | Net Income $567.0M\n- **2020:** Total Assets $17.3B | Net Income $950.0M\n\nMicrosoft's trajectory shows steady asset accumulation and profitability growth through 2019, with a slight net income decline in 2020 despite continued asset growth. NVIDIA's pattern reveals severe profitability compression in 2019 followed by partial recovery in 2020, despite growing asset base.\n\n## AI Strategy and Competitive Positioning\n\nMicrosoft's MD&A for fiscal 2020 emphasizes cloud infrastructure as a growth driver: \"Intelligent Cloud revenue increased, driven by server products and cloud services\" [MSFT, FY 2020, Item 7: MD&A]. This reflects Microsoft's strategic pivot toward enterprise AI and cloud computing, positioning the company as an infrastructure provider rather than a GPU manufacturer.\n\nNVIDIA's management, by contrast, highlighted AI as a core growth engine but faced execution challenges. In fiscal 2018, management noted that \"Datacenter revenue, including our Tesla, NVIDIA GRID, and DGX-1 brands, increased by 145%, reflecting strong demand for deep learning training for AI, cloud, accelerated, and virtualized computing\" [NVDA, FY 2018, Item 7: MD&A]. However, this momentum stalled in 2019. Management disclosed that \"sales of certain high-end GeForce gaming GPUs using our new Turing architecture that we released during fiscal year 2019 were lower than we expected for the launch of a new architecture\" [NVDA, FY 2019, Item 7: MD&A], indicating competitive and demand challenges.\n\n## Supply Chain and Demand Volatility Risks\n\nNVIDIA's Risk Factors sections across 2018-2020 consistently flagged supply chain vulnerabilities and demand concentration. The 2018 filing warned of \"fluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies\" and \"our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services\" [NVDA, FY 2018, Item 1A: Risk Factors]. This proved prescient: cryptocurrency mining demand collapsed in 2019, contributing to NVIDIA's profitability decline.\n\nBy 2020, NVIDIA management acknowledged customer concentration risk: \"For fiscal year 2020, 11% of our total revenue was from one customer, Dell\" [NVDA, FY 2020, Item 1A: Risk Factors]. The filing also noted that \"most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, which permits our customers to cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty\" [NVDA, FY 2020, Item 1A: Risk Factors], exposing the company to sudden demand shifts.\n\nMicrosoft's 2020 MD&A emphasized diversified revenue streams across segments: \"Revenue increased $17.2 billion or 14%, driven by growth across each of our segments\" [MSFT, FY 2020, Item 7: MD&A], suggesting more resilient demand patterns and less exposure to cyclical markets like gaming or cryptocurrency.\n\n## Operational Efficiency Divergence\n\nNVIDIA's 2020 MD&A revealed operational strain: \"Operating expenses for fiscal year 2020 were $3.92 billion, up 16% from a year ago, reflecting primarily employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs\" [NVDA, FY 2020, Item 7: MD&A]. Despite this spending increase, \"Income from operations for fiscal year 2020 was $2.85 billion, down 25% from a year earlier\" [NVDA, FY 2020, Item 7: MD&A], indicating margin compression and operational leverage challenges.\n\nMicrosoft's consistent asset growth and profitability through 2019 reflected superior operational leverage in cloud infrastructure, though 2020 net income declined slightly despite asset growth, potentially reflecting pandemic-related investments or market saturation in certain segments.\n\n## Data Limitations\n\nThe provided data lacks explicit Operating Income figures for both companies across all years, limiting analysis of operational efficiency trends. Revenue data for Microsoft is not included in the KPI snapshot, preventing direct revenue comparison. The narrative context does not contain detailed forward-looking AI investment disclosures that would fully explain strategic positioning beyond current-year results.",

particularly in China have impacted consumer demand for our GeForce gaming GPU products.\n\nIn addition, sales of certain high-end GeForce gaming GPUs using our new Turing architecture that we released during fiscal year 2019 were lower than we expected for the launch of a new architecture.\n\nAs a result, during a portion of fiscal year 2019, we shipped a higher amount of desktop gaming GPU products relative to where end user demand turned out to be and subsequently compensated by shipping a lower amount of desktop gaming GPU products relative to end user demand to allow the channel to work down that inventory.\n\nFor fiscal year 2020, we expect our Gaming revenue to be slightly down compared to fiscal year 2019, with expected growth from sales of Turing-based GPU products and notebook GPU products partially offsetting decreases that we believe were caused by the previously-noted factors.\n\nProfessional visualization revenue was $1.13 billion, up 21% from a year earlier driven by strength across both desktop and mobile workstation products.\n\nDatacenter revenue was $2.93 billion, up 52% from a year ago, led by strong sales of our Volta architecture-based products, including NVIDIA Tesla V100 and DGX systems.\n\nToward the end of fiscal year 2019, we believe that customers across broad-based vertical markets and geographies became increasingly cautious due to economic uncertainty, and a number of Datacenter deals did not close.\n\nHowever, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.\n\nResults of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of revenue.\n\nRevenue Revenue by Reportable Segments GPU Business.\n\nGPU business revenue increased by 25% in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018.\n\nThis increase was due primarily to 18% growth in sales of GeForce GPU products for gaming, driven by initial sales of Turing-based GPUs for desktops and by high-performance notebooks based on our Max-Q technology.\n\nDatacenter revenue, including Tesla, GRID and DGX, increased 52%, reflecting strong sales of our Volta architecture products, including NVIDIA Tesla V100 and DGX systems.\n\nRevenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased 21% due primarily to higher sales across desktop and mobile workstation products.\n\n\n=== [NVDA] NVIDIA CORP | FY 2020 | Doc:

incentive plans: NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The fair value of shares issued under our ESPP have been estimated with the following assumptions: For ESPP shares, the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the purchase date.\n\nThe risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest rates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term.\n\nOur expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated using historical volatility.\n\n\n=== [NVDA] NVIDIA CORP | FY 2020 | Doc: 0001045810_10-K_2020 | Item 1A: Risk Factors | Sentences: 0001045810_10-K_2020_section_1A_109 - 0001045810_10-K_2020_section_1A_205 ===\n\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our partner network and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.\n\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network.\n\nWith several of these distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels.\n\nFor fiscal year 2020, 11% of our total revenue was from one customer, Dell.\n\nOur operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our GPUs and Tegra processors.\n\nIn the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products than they did in the past, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way, particularly because: • most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, which permits our customers to cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty; • our partners may develop their own solutions; • our customers may purchase products from our competitors; or • our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products.\n\nWe could also be restricted from selling our products or providing our technology and services due to U.S. trade restrictions.\n\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.\n\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors.\n\nTherefore, investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance.\n\nFactors, other than those described elsewhere in these risk factors, that could affect our results of operations in the future include, but are not limited to: • our ability to achieve volume production of our next-generation products; • our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services; • fluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies; • changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our partners’ products; • our ability to cover the manufacturing and design costs of our products through competitive pricing; • our ability to comply and continue to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations; • product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues; • our ability to secure appropriate safety certifications and meet industry safety standards; • supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our products • inventory write-downs; • our ability to continue generating revenue from our partner network, including by generating sales within our partner network and ensuring our products are incorporated into our partners product ecosystems, and our partner network’s ability to sell products that incorporate our GPUs and Tegra processors; • the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments to us, and our ability to obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers; • customer bad debt write-offs; • any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; • unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property; • changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards; and • general macroeconomic or industry events and factors affecting the overall market and our target markets.\n\nAny one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results.\n\nAny such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility.\n\nPrivacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential users from using our products and services, result in liability, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings.\n\nThese provisions include the following: • the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval; • the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent; • advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; • the ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval; • a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws; • the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders; and • the ability of our Board of Directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws.\n\nOn March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox.\n\nUnder the agreement, if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock.\n\nThe Microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA.\n\nThese provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.\n\n\n=== [NVDA] NVIDIA CORP | FY 2020 | Doc: 0001045810_10-K_2020 | Item 7: Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) | Sentences: 0001045810_10-K_2020_section_7_9 -

researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users.\n\nOur Tegra brand incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for game consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices.\n\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\n\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges Fiscal Year 2020 Summary Revenue for fiscal year 2020 was $10.92 billion, down 7% from a year earlier.\n\nGPU business revenue was $9.47 billion, down 7% from a year earlier.\n\nTegra Processor business revenue - which includes Automotive, SoCs for gaming platforms, and embedded edge AI platforms - was $1.45 billion, down 6% from a year earlier.\n\nFrom a market platform perspective, Gaming revenue was $5.52 billion, down 12% from a year ago, reflecting lower sales of GeForce desktop GPUs and SoCs for gaming platforms, partially offset by growth in GeForce notebook GPUs.\n\nOEM and Other revenue was $505 million, down 34% from a year ago, primarily due to the absence of cryptocurrency-specific product sales.\n\nGross margin for fiscal year 2020 was 62.0%, up 80 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components.\n\nOperating expenses for fiscal year 2020 were $3.92 billion, up 16% from a year ago, reflecting primarily employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including stock-based compensation and infrastructure costs.\n\nIncome from operations for fiscal year 2020 was $2.85 billion, down 25% from a year earlier.\n\nNet income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2020 were $2.80 billion and $4.52, respectively, both down 32% from a year earlier reflecting lower revenue and higher operating expenses.\n\nOn March 10, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Mellanox Technologies Ltd., or Mellanox, pursuant to which we will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Mellanox for $125 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $6.9 billion as of the date of the Merger Agreement.\n\nThe Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants.\n\nThe consummation of the merger is conditioned on the receipt of the approval of Mellanox shareholders, as well as the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement.\n\nWe performed our annual goodwill assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 using a qualitative assessment and concluded there was no goodwill impairment.\n\nRefer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nResults of Operations A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 is presented below.\n\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 27, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2019, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com.\n\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of revenue.\n\nRevenue Revenue by Reportable Segments GPU Business.\n\nGPU business revenue decreased by 7% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, which reflects a decline in GPUs sold for gaming.\n\nGeForce GPU product sales for gaming decreased by 10%, reflecting lower sales of GeForce desktop GPUs and SoCs for gaming platforms, partially offset by growth in GeForce notebook GPUs.\n\nRevenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased by 7%, reflecting strength in desktop and notebook workstations.\n\nData Center revenue, which includes Tesla, GRID and DGX, increased by 2%, driven by vertical industry growth partially offset by lower hyperscale sales.\n\nTegra Processor Business.\n\nTegra Processor business revenue decreased by 6% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019.\n\nThis was driven by a decline in revenue from SoCs for gaming platforms, which was partially offset by an increase of 9% in Automotive revenue, reflecting growth in AI cockpit solutions and development services agreements.\n\nConcentration of Revenue Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 92% and 87% of total revenue for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nRevenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location.\n\nDell represented approximately 11% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020 and was attributable to the GPU business.\n\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2019.\n\nGross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue.\n\nCost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, and shipping costs.\n\nCost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.\n\nOur overall gross margin was 62.0% and 61.2% for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nThe increase in fiscal year 2020 was driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components.\n\nInventory provisions totaled $161 million and $270 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nSales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $145 million and $41 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nAs a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was insignificant in fiscal year 2020 and an unfavorable impact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019.\n\nA discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows: GPU Business.\n\nThe gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2020 when compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components.\n\nTegra Processor Business.\n\nThe gross margin of our Tegra Processor business was relatively flat during fiscal year 2020 when compared to fiscal year 2019.\n\nOperating Expenses Research and Development Research and development expenses increased by 19% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs and stock-based compensation expense.\n\nRefer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources As of January 26, 2020, we had $10.90 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $3.48 billion from the end of fiscal year 2019.\n\nOur investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain limits on our portfolio duration.\n\nCash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to changes in working capital driven by a reduction in inventory, partially offset by a decrease in operating income.\n\nCash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to lower purchases, higher sales, and lower maturities of marketable securities in preparation for the acquisition of Mellanox.\n\nCash used in financing activities decreased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to no share repurchases in fiscal year 2020 and lower tax payments related to employee stock plans.\n\nLiquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations.\n\n\n\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nUSER QUESTION\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nFor NVIDIA and
