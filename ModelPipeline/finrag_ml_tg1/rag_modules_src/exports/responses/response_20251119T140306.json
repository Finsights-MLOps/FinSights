  "query": "What operational or supply chain risks does Walmart Inc. highlight in its 2011 Risk Factors section?",
  "answer": "I cannot provide information about Walmart's 2011 Risk Factors section based on the data provided to me. The narrative context I have access to covers Walmart's fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020 only, with excerpts primarily from Management Discussion & Analysis sections rather than the Risk Factors section.\n\n**What I Can Tell You About Walmart's Risk Disclosures (FY 2018-2020)**\n\nWhile I cannot address your specific question about 2011, the provided filings from later years do reference that Walmart discusses various operational risks in their Item 1A Risk Factors sections. The MD&A sections mention that detailed risk information can be found in those Risk Factors sections, but the actual Risk Factors content is not included in the data I received.\n\n**General Risk Categories Mentioned (FY 2018-2020)**\n\nThe MD&A sections do acknowledge that Walmart and the retail industry broadly face numerous operational challenges, including:\n\n- Catastrophic events and weather patterns affecting operations [WMT, FY 2018, Item 7: MD&A]\n- Competitive pressures in attracting and retaining quality employees [WMT, FY 2019, Item 7: MD&A]\n- Currency exchange rate volatility impacting international operations [WMT, FY 2020, Item 7: MD&A]\n- Supply-related factors such as cost of goods and fuel/energy prices [WMT, FY 2019, Item 7: MD&A]\n- Cybersecurity attacks [WMT, FY 2018, Item 7: MD&A]\n\nHowever, these are general acknowledgments rather than the detailed risk factor disclosures you're seeking from 2011.\n\n**To Answer Your Question**\n\nYou would need access to Walmart's fiscal 2011 10-K filing, specifically the Item 1A Risk Factors section, to get the operational and supply chain risk disclosures from that period.",

Business, which include the following: • Acquisition of 81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart Private Limited (\"Flipkart\") in August 2018.\n\nIn the future, if the held for sale classification criteria is met for the disposal group, we expect to recognize a loss, the amount of which may fluctuate based on the changes in the value of share capital received and foreign exchange rates.\n\n• Divestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (\"Advent\") in August 2018, for which we recorded a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion in fiscal 2019.\n\n• Divestiture of banking operations in Walmart Chile in December 2018 and the proposed divestiture of banking operations in Walmart Canada, classified as held for sale as of January 31, 2019.\n\nThe Retail Industry We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve.\n\nWe face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses.\n\nMany of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence.\n\nWe also compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees (\"associates\").\n\nWe, along with other

costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment.\n\nFurther information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found herein under \"Item 1A.\n\nRisk Factors,\" and under \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\n\nCompany Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs.\n\nAt times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate.\n\nWe define our financial framework as: • strong, efficient growth; • consistent operating discipline; and • strategic capital allocation.\n\nThe timing of the payment, if any, associated with these liabilities is uncertain.\n\nRefer to Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits.\n\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements As of January 31, 2019, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\n\nOther Matters We discuss

herein.\n\nWe discuss the \"ASDA Equal Value Claims\" which includes certain existing employment claims against our United Kingdom subsidiary, ASDA Stores, Ltd., including certain risks arising therefrom, in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the caption \"Risk Factors\" and under the sub-caption \"Legal Proceedings\" in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned \"Contingencies,\" and appears elsewhere herein.\n\nWe also discuss the National Prescription Opiate Litigation and related matters including certain risks arising therefrom, in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the caption \"Risk Factors\" and under the sub-caption \"Legal Proceedings\" in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned \"Contingencies,\" and appears elsewhere herein.\n\nWe also discuss various legal proceedings related to the FCPA investigation, ASDA Equal Value Claims, and National Prescription Opiate Litigation in Part I, Item 3 herein under the caption \"Legal Proceedings.\"\n\nThe foregoing matters and other matters described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K represent contingent liabilities of the Company that may or may not result in the Company incurring a material liability upon their final resolution.\n\nSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates Management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology.\n\n\n=== [WMT] Walmart Inc. | FY 2020 | Doc: 0000104169_10-K_2020
