  "query": "What does EXXON MOBIL CORP report as its total revenue in 2008, and how is this figure described in the filing?",
  "answer": "I cannot provide ExxonMobil's total revenue for 2008 based on the information provided. The narrative context I have access to only includes excerpts from ExxonMobil's 10-K filings for fiscal years 2016 through 2020. There is no data available from the 2008 fiscal year filing in the retrieved documents.\n\nThe provided excerpts primarily contain:\n- Definitions of Return on Average Capital Employed (ROCE) across multiple years\n- Shareholder information and dividend declarations\n- Forward-looking statement disclaimers\n- General business descriptions and accounting policy changes\n\nTo answer your question about 2008 revenue, I would need access to ExxonMobil's 2008 10-K filing, specifically sections that would contain the Consolidated Statement of Income or Management's Discussion and Analysis sections that discuss revenue performance for that fiscal year.\n\nIf you need information about ExxonMobil's financial performance, I can only provide insights from the 2016-2020 period based on the currently available data.",

===\n\nFREQUENTLY USED TERMS Return on Average Capital Employed Return on average capital employed (ROCE) is a performance measure ratio.\n\nFrom the perspective of the business segments, ROCE is annual business segment earnings divided by average business segment capital employed (average of beginning and end-of-year amounts).\n\nThese segment earnings include ExxonMobil’s share of segment earnings of equity companies, consistent with our capital employed definition, and exclude the cost of financing.\n\nThe Corporation’s total ROCE is net income attributable to ExxonMobil excluding the after-tax cost of financing, divided by total corporate average capital employed.\n\nThe Corporation has consistently applied its ROCE definition for many years and views it as the best measure of historical capital productivity in our capital-intensive, long-term industry, both to evaluate management’s performance and to demonstrate to shareholders that capital has been used wisely over the long term.\n\nAdditional measures, which are more cash flow based, are used to make investment decisions.\n\nQUARTERLY INFORMATION (1) Petroleum product and chemical prime product sales data reported

markets in North America and Europe, as well as in the growing Asia Pacific region.\n\nExxonMobil’s fundamental Downstream business strategies competitively position the company across a range of market conditions.\n\nThese strategies include targeting best-in-class operations in all aspects of the business, maximizing value from advanced technologies, capitalizing on integration across ExxonMobil businesses, selectively investing for resilient, advantaged returns, operating efficiently and effectively, and providing quality, valued and differentiated products and services to customers.\n\nExxonMobil’s operating results, as noted in Item 2.\n\nProperties, reflect 22 refineries, located in 14 countries, with distillation capacity of 4.9 million barrels per day and lubricant basestock manufacturing capacity of 125 thousand barrels per day.\n\nExxonMobil’s fuels and lubes value chains have significant global reach, with multiple channels to market serving a diverse customer base.\n\nOur portfolio of world-renowned brands includes Exxon, Mobil, Esso and Mobil 1.\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2.\n\nAccounting Changes Effective December 31, 2017, the Corporation revised its accounting policy election related to the reporting of certain sales and value-added taxes imposed on and concurrent with revenue-producing transactions with customers and collected on behalf of governmental authorities (sales-based taxes).\n\nThis changes reporting of sales-based taxes from gross reporting (included in both “Sales and other operating revenue” and “Sales-based taxes”) to the preferable method of net reporting (excluded from both “Sales and other operating revenue” and “Sales-based taxes”) in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nThe revised election makes reported revenue more consistent with ExxonMobil’s role as an agent for the government and is more consistent with the reporting practices of other international major oil and gas companies and the largest U.S. companies.\n\nThis change in accounting principle was applied retrospectively and does not affect net income attributable to ExxonMobil.\n\nAlso effective December 31, 2017, the Corporation reclassified U.S. Federal excise tax from “Sales-based taxes” to “Other taxes and duties”.\n\nFor these taxes ExxonMobil is not considered to be an agent for the government and these taxes will continue to be reported gross.\n\nThe amount reclassified was $3,110 million in 2016 and $3,044 million in 2015.\n\nThis change in classification was applied retrospectively and does not affect net income attributable to ExxonMobil.\n\nEffective January 1, 2018, ExxonMobil adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s standard, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended.\n\nThe standard establishes a single revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry and transaction specific requirements, and expands disclosure requirements.\n\nThe standard was adopted using the Modified Retrospective method, under which prior year results are not restated, but supplemental information on the impact of the new standard must be provided for 2018 results, if material.\n\n\n=== [XOM] EXXON MOBIL CORP | FY 2018 | Doc: 0000034088_10-K_2018 | Item 15: Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules | Sentences:

percent, 13 percent and 14 percent in the years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nThe Corporation’s ownership in these ventures is in the form of shares in corporate joint ventures as well as interests in partnerships.\n\nDifferences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the factors giving rise to the difference.\n\nThe amortization of this difference, as appropriate, is included in “Income from equity affiliates” on the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n\n\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nUSER
