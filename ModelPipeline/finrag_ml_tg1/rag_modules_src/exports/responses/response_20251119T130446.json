The company emphasized that cyber-threats require \"significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities\" [MA, FY 2017-2020, Item 1A: Risk Factors]. Beyond their own systems, Mastercard highlighted exposure to \"account data compromise events involving merchants and third-party payment processors\" affecting millions of cardholders, noting that such breaches could cause \"reputational damage and/or lawsuits\" and \"decrease the use and acceptance of our integrated products and services\" [MA, FY 2017-2020, Item 1A: Risk Factors].\n\n## Recommendation\n\nTo answer your question accurately, I would need access to the actual 2009 Form 10-K filings for all three companies.

Industry Regulation Global regulatory and legislative activity directly related to the payments industry may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.\n\nRegulators increasingly seek to regulate certain aspects of payments systems such as ours, or establish or expand their authority to do so.\n\nMany jurisdictions have enacted such regulations, establishing, and potentially further expanding, obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products and services that we may offer to financial institutions for consumers, the countries in which our integrated products and services may be used, the way we structure and operate our business and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products or services.\n\nLarge scale consolidation within processors could result in these processors developing bilateral agreements or in some cases switching the entire transaction on their own network,

products that compete with or replace value-added products and services we currently provide to support our switched transaction and payment offerings.\n\nThese products could replace our own switching and payments offerings or could force us to change our pricing or practices for these offerings.\n\nThe payments markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, new product introductions, evolving industry standards and changing customer and consumer needs.\n\nIn order to remain competitive and meet the needs of the payments market, we are continually involved in diversifying our integrated products and services.\n\nThese efforts carry the risks associated with any diversification initiative, including cost overruns, delays in delivery and performance problems.\n\nThese projects also carry risks associated with working with different types of customers, for example organizations such as corporations that are not financial 24 MASTERCARD 2019 FORM 10-K PART I ITEM 1A.\n\nRISK FACTORS institutions and non-governmental organizations (“NGOs”), and end users other than those we have traditionally worked with.\n\nThese differences may present new operational challenges in the development and implementation of our new products or services.\n\nOur failure to render these integrated products and services could make our other integrated products and services less desirable to customers, or put us at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nAs a result, information security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us.\n\nAs cyber-threats

mitigation efforts that we undertake, there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer material breaches and resulting losses in the future, or that our insurance coverage would be sufficient to cover all losses.\n\nOur risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, our prominent size and scale and our role in the global payments and technology industries, our plans to continue to implement our digital and mobile channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers and account holders when and how they want to be served, our global presence, our extensive use of third-party vendors and future joint venture and merger and
