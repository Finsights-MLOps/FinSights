  "query": "Where does Tesla define Adjusted EBITDA in its 2022 Form 10-K, and how does the company describe that metric?",
  "answer": "I cannot answer this question based on the provided data. The narrative context and KPI facts available to me are limited to Tesla's Form 10-K filings from fiscal years 2016, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Your question specifically asks about Tesla's 2022 Form 10-K, which is not included in the documents provided to me.\n\nTo obtain information about how Tesla defines Adjusted EBITDA in its 2022 Form 10-K, you would need to:\n\n1. Access Tesla's 2022 Form 10-K filing directly through the SEC's EDGAR database (sec.gov)\n2. Search for \"Adjusted EBITDA\" in the Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) section or the financial statements notes\n3. Review any reconciliation tables that typically accompany non-GAAP financial metrics\n\n**Scope Limitation:** My knowledge is strictly limited to the 10-K filing data provided in this session. I cannot access filings outside the years 2016, 2018-2020 for Tesla, nor can I retrieve additional documents not already supplied.\n\nIf you have questions about Tesla's financial metrics, accounting policies, or business operations from the 2016, 2018, 2019, or 2020 fiscal years, I would be happy to help with those.",
