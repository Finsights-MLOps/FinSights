  "query": "How does MICROSOFT CORP describe the change in its Intelligent Cloud revenue in 2017, including both the direction and magnitude of the change?",
  "answer": "# Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud Revenue Change in FY 2017\n\nMicrosoft's Intelligent Cloud segment experienced **positive growth** in fiscal year 2017, with revenue increasing **$2.4 billion or 10%** compared to fiscal year 2016 [MSFT, FY 2017, Item 7: MD&A].\n\n## Revenue Drivers\n\nThe growth was primarily driven by two components:\n\n**Server Products and Cloud Services** contributed the majority of the increase, growing **$2.5 billion or 13%**. This was fueled by exceptional Azure performance, which achieved **99% revenue growth**, alongside more modest growth of 4% in server products licensed on-premises [MSFT, FY 2017, Item 7: MD&A].\n\n**Enterprise Services**, however, presented a contrasting picture, with revenue **decreasing 2%**. This decline was attributed to lower revenue from custom support agreements, though it was partially offset by higher revenue from Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services [MSFT, FY 2017, Item 7: MD&A].\n\n## Profitability Impact\n\nDespite the revenue growth, operating income for the Intelligent Cloud segment actually **decreased $177 million or 2%**. This decline occurred because operating expenses increased $973 million or 11%, driven by strategic investments in sales capacity, cloud engineering, and developer engagement. The expense growth outpaced the gross margin increase of $796 million or 4% [MSFT, FY 2017, Item 7: MD&A].\n\nThe segment's gross margin percentage decreased due to an increased mix of cloud offerings and lower Enterprise Services gross margin percentage, though this was partially offset by improvements in Azure's gross margin percentage [MSFT, FY 2017, Item 7: MD&A].",

volume licensing programs.\n\nUnearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period.\n\nUnearned revenue as of June 30, 2017 also included

versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.\n\n\n=== [MSFT] MICROSOFT CORP | FY 2017 | Doc: 0000789019_10-K_2017 | Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data |

Software Assurance, we will recognize license revenue at the time of contract execution rather than over the subscription period.\n\nDue to the complexity of certain of our commercial license subscription contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will depend on contract-specific terms and in some instances may vary from recognition at the time of billing.\n\nRevenue recognition related to our hardware, cloud offerings such as Office 365, LinkedIn, and professional services will remain substantially unchanged.\n\nAdoption of the standard will result in the recognition of additional revenue of $6.6 billion and $5.8 billion for fiscal year 2017 and 2016, respectively, and an increase in the provision for income taxes of $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, primarily due to the net change in Windows 10 revenue recognition.\n\nIn addition, adoption of the standard will result in an increase in accounts receivable and other current and long-term assets of $2.7 billion and $4.2 billion, as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, driven by unbilled receivables from upfront recognition of revenue for certain multi-year commercial software subscriptions that include both distinct software licenses and Software Assurance; a reduction of unearned revenue of $17.8 billion and $11.7 billion as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, driven by the upfront recognition of license revenue from Windows 10 and certain multi-year commercial software subscriptions; and an increase in deferred income taxes of $5.2 billion and $4.8 billion as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, driven by the upfront recognition of revenue.\n\nSee Expected Impacts to Reported Results below for the impact of adoption of the standard on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nExpected Impacts to Reported Results Adoption of the standards related to revenue recognition and leases is expected to impact our reported results as follows: PART II Item 8 Adoption of the standards related to revenue recognition and leases had no impact to cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing on our consolidated cash flows statements.\n\nNOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.\n\nRevenue,

businesses and the impracticability of determining the geographic source of the revenue.\n\nRevenue from external customers, classified by significant product and service offerings, were as follows: (a) Includes the net revenue deferral from Windows 10.\n\n(b) Includes advertising revenue.\n\nOur total commercial cloud revenue, which primarily comprises Office 365 commercial, Azure, Dynamics 365, and other cloud properties, was $14.9 billion, $9.5 billion, and $5.8 billion in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\n\nThese amounts are included in their respective product categories in the table above.\n\nPART II Item 8 Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations.\n\nA portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment; it is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or
