acquired company do not allow us to recognize revenues on a timely basis; • we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies, products, services and their related supply chain operations with our existing lines of business and supply chain infrastructure and maintaining uniform standards, architecture, controls, procedures and policies; • we may have multiple product lines or services
