    "answer_type": "span",
    "answer_text": "MBIA presents a consistent structure in how it organizes and labels risk factors over time. In earlier filings it groups them into categories such as Insured Portfolio Loss Related Risk Factors, Legal, Regulatory and Other Risk Factors, Capital, Liquidity and Market Related Risk Factors and MBIA Corp. Risk Factors, generally listing items in order of significance within each category. In later years it refines these headings slightly, adding or separating General Risk Factors or Strategic Plan Related Risk Factors, but continues to emphasize the same core themes: credit performance of the insured portfolio, legal and regulatory challenges, capital and liquidity constraints and company-specific execution risks. The stable categorization underscores that these remain the primary lenses through which the company views its risk profile.",

    "answer_type": "span",
    "answer_text": "Across this diverse group of issuers, regulatory, legal and policy risk is portrayed as both pervasive and highly specific to each sector. Mortgage and insurance groups like Radian and Genworth emphasize capital, reserve and housing-finance rules, warning that changes in PMIERs, RBC or other insurance standards, as well as actions by state and federal regulators, could restrict their ability to write business or trigger supervisory intervention. Payments networks such as Visa and Mastercard focus on interchange and routing rules, government and central bank oversight, and the risk that new regulations or competition-driven mandates could pressure pricing, volumes or required on-shore processing. Technology and platform companies, including Meta, Alphabet and Amazon, highlight cybersecurity disclosure obligations, data privacy and content-moderation regimes, and increasingly, AI- and DMA-style frameworks that may impose new compliance burdens, fines or constraints on how their services operate. Industrial and energy names like Tesla, ExxonMobil and others point to environmental, climate and product-compliance rules and the role of regulatory credits. Collectively, the disclosures show that evolving regulation can affect everything from capital and liquidity to product design, data use, transaction routing and market access, with many companies explicitly tying these risks to potential impacts on growth, profitability and strategic flexibility.",
