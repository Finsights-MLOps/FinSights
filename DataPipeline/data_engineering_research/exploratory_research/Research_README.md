### Polars Research:
1. Experimental analysis and prototyping conducted in parallel research repository for rapid iteration and evaluation. Research is being done in a separate repo: `finrag-insights-mlops/`

These notebooks or files are **reference files** and cannot be executed in this environment due to:
    - External dependencies on separate environment configurations (CUDA, llama-cpp bindings, llama cpp server, OpenAI API, etc.)
    - API keys and cloud credentials not included in this repository  
    - Mostly **Hardware CUDA issues** Local GPU inference (NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti) and **Volatile Dependencies** Rotating dependency versions during research.
