### Polars Research:
1. Experimental analysis and prototyping conducted in parallel research repository for rapid iteration and evaluation. Research is being done in a separate repo: `finrag-insights-mlops/`

These notebooks or files are **reference files** and cannot be executed in this environment due to:
<<<<<<< HEAD
    - External dependencies on separate environment configurations (CUDA, llama-    cpp bindings, llama cpp server, OpenAI API, etc.)
